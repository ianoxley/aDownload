aDownload
=========
_NB As of writing this extension is only supported in the Google Chrome Dev Channel or Canary build_

aDownload is a Chrome extension that adds a __download__ attribute to each downloadable link on a page. This will force the browser to download the file rather than try to render it in the browser.

An options page allows the user to configure which file extensions should watched for. 

TODO
----
1. Add CSS to the options page
2. Add a proper icon
